        <p>You'll have to agree that animals are some of the best companions we've ever had. Whether you're afraid of animals or not, you definitely have a place for them in your heart. 
            From genes to morphology to behavior, humans and monkeys are similar in many ways because they share an evolutionary past. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Most of us would've had at least one encounter with them. 
            Here, we will talk about how important it is to take care of animals and why we should never use force against them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Animals are important for many reasons, including the assistance they give to plant ecosystems, the psychological and emotional support they can offer to humans 
            and the knowledge gained from the human study of them. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When an animal is abused, it would most likely become insecure and try to attack someone in its next encounter 
            with a human. Even in most zoos, where we find entertainment, animals are beaten up, whipped and treated like 'items'.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here, we will talk about how important it is to value the lives of animals just as much as we value our own.

        <h3>Why is it important to feed your pet a high quality food?</h3>
        <p>It’s important because one definite way any pet owner can affect the longevity and quality of life for their pet is by providing the 
            highest quality food they can. The quality of the food you feed makes a direct difference in your pet’s health. Quality is the key word, 
            quality of the ingredients that go into the making of the pet food you feed. The old saying “You are what you eat” applies to our pets in 
            the same ways as it does for ourselves. Better quality foods made with better quality ingredients provide a better quality of life. The 
            result is fewer skin conditions, less itching, fewer ear infections, shinier coats, less inflammatory bowel disease, better muscling and 
            muscle tone, stronger bones, more energy, better temperament and other immediate physical benefits of better nutrition. Dogs are happier 
            and feel better overall. Better nutrition, provides an overall boost in the immune system and improved health over the long term with 
            less stress on the pet’s organs. The kidneys and liver have to work very hard to remove toxins such as chemicals, preservatives, dyes 
            and other non-supportive elements of the pet’s food out of their body. At the same time their body is working so hard to remove these, 
            they are working from a sometimes malnourished state because the food they’re eating is full of fillers or by-products that make them 
            feel full but does not provide the nourishment needed for a healthy body. When the body’s not healthy, the mind is distracted by not 
            feeling well and the spirit of the pet can be compromised because it just does not feel as well as it could or should.</p>
            <br>
        <h3>Need for Pet Supplies</h3>
        <p>Pets are just like any other family member and need a lot of supplies which include food items, medicines, clothes or houses, shampoos 
            and soaps for washing etc. Every pet owner likes to provide the best of supplies to his/her pet. This means buying the best quality of 
            food and other products to ensure that the pet remains healthy and grows according to its age. The best way to buy good quality pet 
            supplies is to get in touch with specialized pharmacies that deal in household products. According to statistics quoted by the American 
            Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the average cost of basic food, supplies, medical care and training for a dog or a cat 
            is $700 to $875 annually. You can buy good quality pet supplies at discounted prices from varied online pharmacies that focus on selling 
            supplies of all types and all price ranges.</p>
            <br>
        <h3>Need for entertainment and toys</h3>
        <p>Dogs are social predators, therefore you should focus on creative activities that stimulate their sensory and predatory behaviors. 
            Ever notice how fast your pup’s tail moves when you get him a new bone or take him on a run with you? That’s because he enjoys the 
            challenging interaction… and he loves gifts, too (who doesn’t?) Most people can agree that dogs and cats are very different. 
            Dogs are more like the goofy class clown, and cats are more vigilant with highly-developed senses. Cats are always observing and moving 
            around. Toys that provide movement, like a feather chaser, are great for them. (In case you're wondering, although catnip isn’t considered 
            an enrichment toy, it’s still a kind of enrichment because the scent amazes and excites them.)</p>

        <h3>The Importance of your Pet's Health</h3>
        <p>There are many health benefits of owning a pet. They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. Regular walking or 
            playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels.  Pets can help manage loneliness and depression
             by giving us companionship. Most households in the United States have at least one pet.
            Studies have shown that the bond between people and their pets can increase fitness, lower stress, and bring happiness to their owners. 
            Some of the health benefits of having a pet include: <br>
            - Decreased blood pressure <br>
            - Decreased cholesterol levels <br>
            - Decreased triglyceride levels <br>
            - Decreased feelings of loneliness <br>
            - Increased opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities <br>
            - Increased opportunities for socialization <br>
            However, pets can sometimes carry harmful germs that can make us sick even when the pet appears healthy. The diseases people get from 
            animals are called zoonotic (zoe-oh-NOT-ic) diseases. Below are some tips to help you and your family stay healthy while enjoying pets.</p>

            Over 40 Animals Saved From Terrible Conditions at Gaza Zoo!
            Gaza Zoo became unable to care for the animals due to human conflicts between Israel and Palestine. The conflicts resulted in blockades which led to economic struggles in Gaza. 
            This left the owner of Gaza Zoo unable to properly care for the animals. The terrible conditions led to the death of four lion cubs during a storm in January, a monkey killing 
            another, and the death of a porcupine. Some animals have even died due to bombings in the area. In an attempt to make money, Fathy Jomaa, owner of the zoo even recently declawed 
            two young lions so that people could pose for selfies with them. Animal Welfare Organization, Four Paws wanted to save the animals from this place and were fortunately able to 
            come to an agreement with Jomaa.

            We’re Living in an Anthropocentric World.
            According to the philosophy of anthropocentrism, humans are “separate from and superior to nature” and “human life has intrinsic value while other entities (including animals, 
            plants, mineral resources, and so on) are resources that may justifiably be exploited for the benefit of humankind.” This philosophy so strongly characterizes the state of our 
            current world and how humans have impacted it, that some scientists refer to the current epoch as the Anthropocene. The general consensus is that the Anthropocene began in 1950 
            “when human activity started to have a significant impact on the planet’s climate and ecosystems.”

            37 Rescued Spotted Seal Pups Released Back Into the Sea!
            In February, Dalian police in China found 71 stolen seal pups in a shed at a remote coastal farm that were taken from the wild by traffickers. They planned to sell the seals to 
            aquariums and commercial venues like shops and restaurants for display. The seal pups were so young they hadn’t even been weaned and were in such distress that 29 pups had already 
            died and 20 more were found buried nearby. Some pups who were sick unfortunately died since the rescue, but the healthy ones that survived were released back into the sea by Humane 
            Society International!

            Endangered Moon Bear Cubs, Sugar and Spice, Rescued From Cruel Circus.
            Two moon bear cubs were being held captive illegally at a circus in Hanoi, Vietnam. The bear cubs were taken from their mother, who was killed, according to Animals Asia and being 
            forced to perform for audiences. They were kept hungry so that they’d chase morsels of food on stage. Thankfully, authorities worked with Animals Asia to quickly rescue the cubs, 
            Sugar and Spice who are just months old.

            Chile’s Last Circus Elephant is Retired to a Sanctuary!
            Ramba the Elephant spent 50 years all alone in a circus. The Asian elephant was first forced into circus life in Argentina and later in Chile. In 1997, she was “confiscated” from a 
            circus called Los Tachuelas because she was suffering abuse and neglect. Despite being “confiscated,” she actually had to stay with the circus, just wasn’t able to perform anymore. 
            After many years of hard work on behalf of Chilean NGO Ecopolis and elephant experts Scott Blais and Kat Blais, Ramba was rescued and it marks the official end of performing circus 
            elephants in Chile.

            Paralyzed Rescue Dog From Iran Lives a Happy Life Now!
            Pani, a sweet little dog rescued from Iran, found her furever home with none other than her foster mom who already loves her and takes 
            great care of her. Pani was found on the streets of Tehran with a severe spinal injury that left her bottom legs paralyzed. After spending 
            a year in a sanctuary in Iran, Pani was sent to the Animal Haven in NYC so that she could be given rehabilitation. Pani spent just one 
            night at the shelter before being picked up by Tedi Sarah, a child life specialist and vegan lifestyle blogger who had previously fostered 
            21 dogs and a kitten. Tedi thought she could foster Pani until she was adopted as well, and then continue fostering to help more dogs. 
            However, little did she know, Pani was meant to be in her life forever!

            The India Wildlife SOS team worked quickly to save this three-year old male leopard in Maharasthra from a dangerous jaw trap, which is a 
            type of lethal poaching trap. The wildlife team had to sedate the injured cat before they could help carefully remove it from the trap. 
            Luckily, the leopard sustained no internal injuries or broken bones. The cuts and scrapes it did have were cleaned up and treated so that 
            the leopard could heal successfully.

            goat joined the fast little lamb who was found running along the Gowanus Expressway just a few days before.

            Rabbit Rescued From Lab Where Vet Techs Injected Him Constantly.
            Fred spent his life in a cage the size of a shoebox at a vet tech school. He was used as a prop for the vet techs to practice restraint 
            techniques and injections. As the tattoo in his ear shows, he was simply known as 21M, but thanks to a student who stepped up to save him,

            Endangered Baby Pangolin Was Rescued from Poachers and Released Into the Wild!
            A baby pangolin estimated to be just under a year old was rescued by the ZoPosological Society of London (ZSL) from poachers. It’s believed
            the small animal (about the size of a puppy) was kept alive because poachers can make more money by selling a live pangolin for its scales
            and meat than a dead one. The poachers took the baby at night from the wild. The pangolin, nicknamed Kosin, was released back into the 
            wild!

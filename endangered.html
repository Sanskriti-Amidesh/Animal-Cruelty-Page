            <p><b> Blue Whales </b><br>
                Did you know that there is a living thing on Earth today that's heavier than the biggest dinosaur and as long as a full-size basketball 
                court? This incredible animal is the blue whale! Because they're mammals, blue whales can't breathe underwater and have to come to the top 
                of the water to breathe air. Blue whales eat enormous amounts of krill, a tiny animal similar to shrimp. When blue whales eat they first 
                take a giant gulp of water that's full of krill. Their tongue pushes the water out, while baleen plates (pieces of fringe in their mouth) 
                hold the krill in. Blue whales live in colder waters during the summer and swim to warmer waters in the winter. Today there are between 
                10,000 and 25,000 blue whales in the world's oceans. These may seem like big numbers, but blue whales are endangered. Since the late 1800s, 
                several hundred thousand have died because of activities by people. <br>
                <b>Whaling:</b><br>
                Whaling is hunting and killing whales. The speed and weight of blue whales made it hard for whalers to catch them at first. But in the 
                early 1900s, whalers designed new weapons and tools, and they began catching thousands of blue whales every year. Whaling became a big 
                business, where people wanted whale oil to use for soap, candles, lamps, and margarine. They used other parts for meat and fertilizer. 
                In 1966, the International Whaling Commission made it illegal to hunt blue whales.

        <div class="all2"><p><b> Vaquita </b><br>
                The vaquita was first described as a species by two zoologists, Kenneth S. Norris and William N. McFarland, in 1958 after studying the 
                morphology of skull specimens found on the beach. It was not until nearly thirty years later, in 1985, that fresh specimens allowed 
                scientists to describe their external appearance fully. The genus Phocoena comprises four species of porpoise, most of which inhabit 
                coastal waters (the spectacled porpoise is more oceanic). The vaquita is most closely related to Burmeister's porpoise 
                and less so to the spectacled porpoise , two species limited to the Southern Hemisphere. 
                Their ancestors are thought to have moved north across the equator more than 2.5 million years ago during a period of cooling in the 
                Pleistocene. Genome sequencing from an individual captured in 2017 indicates that the ancestral vaquitas had already gone through a 
                major population bottleneck in the past, which may explain why the few remaining individuals are still healthy despite the very low 
                population size. <br>
                <b>Fisheries Bycatch:</b><br>
                The drastic decline in vaquita abundance is the result of fisheries bycatch in commercial and illegal gillnets, including fisheries 
                targeting the now-endangered totoaba, shrimp, and other available fish species. Despite government regulations, including a 
                partial gillnet ban in 2015 and establishment of a permanent gillnet exclusion zone in 2017, illegal fishing remains prevalent in 
                vaquita habitat, and as a result the population has continued to decline.

        <div class="all3"><p><b> North Atlantic Right Whales </b><br>
                Like other right whales, the North Atlantic right whale, also known as the northern right whale or black right whale, is readily 
                distinguished from other cetaceans by the absence of a dorsal fin on its broad back, short, paddle-like pectoral flippers and a long 
                arching mouth that begins above the eye. Its coloration is dark grey to black, with some individuals occasionally having white patches 
                on their stomachs or throats. Other unique features include a large head, which makes up a quarter of its total body length, narrow tail 
                stock in comparison to its wide fluke and v-shaped blowhole which produces a heart shaped blow. <br>
                <b>Whaling:</b><br>
                As the "right" whale continued to float long after being killed, it was possible to 'flense' or strip the whale of blubber without 
                having to take it on board ship. Combined with the right whale's lack of speed through water, feeding habits, and coastal habitat, 
                they were easy to catch, even for whalers equipped only with wooden boats and hand-held harpoons.

        <div class="all4"><p><b> Hawaiian Monk Seal </b><br>
                Its grey coat, white belly, and slender physique distinguish them from their cousin, the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). The monk seal's 
                physique is ideal for hunting its prey: fish, lobster, octopus and squid in deep water coral beds. When it is not hunting and eating, 
                it generally basks on the sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The Hawaiian monk seal is part of the family 
                Phocidae, being named so for its characteristic lack of external ears and inability to rotate its hind flippers under the body. The 
                Hawaiian monk seal has a relatively small, flat head with large black eyes, eight pairs of teeth, and short snouts with the nostril on top 
                of the snout and vibrissae on each side. The nostrils are small vertical slits which close when the seal dives underwater. Additionally, 
                their slender, torpedo-shaped body and hind flippers allow them to be very agile swimmers. <br>
                <b>Whaling:</b><br>
                Natural factors threatening the Hawaiian monk seal include low juvenile survival rates, reduction of habitat/prey associated with 
                environmental changes, increased male aggression, and subsequent skewed gender ratios. Anthropogenic or human impacts include 
                hunting (during the 1800s and 1900s) and the resulting small gene pool, continuing human disturbance, entanglement in marine debris, 
                and fishery interactions.

        <div class="all5"><p><b> Fin Whale </b><br>
                Some scientists have speculated that fin whales circle schools of fish with the white side facing the prey and frightening them into denser 
                schools that are easier for the whale to catch. The fin whale, like other baleen whales, strains its food from the water through baleen 
                plates. Next to the blue whale, the fin whale is the second largest mammal in the world. They have a distinct ridge along their back behind 
                the dorsal fin, which gives it the nickname "razorback.‚Äù Fin whales have a very unusual feature: the lower right jaw is bright white and 
                the lower left jaw is black. <br>
                <b>Whaling:</b><br>
                Like other large whales, fin whales are threatened by environmental change including habitat loss, toxics and climate change. 
                Commercial whaling remains a threat for fin whales. After a two-year hiatus, Iceland resumed commercial fin whaling in 2013 with a 
                quota of 184 whales.
